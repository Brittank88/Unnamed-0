# FAQ

## I see flickering dots / gaps between blocks?

- Disable all settings related to mipmap, antialiasing, anisotropic filtering, etc in Optifine.
- Do the same for the java.exe the game runs with in your graphics card's control panel.
- Restart the game.

At least in my experience, this resolves the issue!
